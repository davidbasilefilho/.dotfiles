* WHAT ARE DOTFILES?
Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your Linux or other Unix-based system.  You can tell that a file is a dotfile because the name of the file will begin with a periodâ€“a dot!  The period at the beginning of a filename or directory name indicates that it is a hidden file or directory.  This repository contains my personal dotfiles.  They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs.

* GETTING STARTED
This section of the README is dedicated to setting up the dots.

** Setting Up the Repo
First, to get access to the files, so you can install the dots, clone the repo with ~git clone https://github.com/DavidBF16/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles~.

** Run the Sync Script
The Sync Script will make symlinks in your home directory.
One alternative to this is to run ~stow .~

#+begin_src shell
# make sure you are in the dotfiles directory:
cd ~/.dotfiles/

# make sure you have the permissions for it
sudo chmod +x bin/sync-dotfiles

# run it
./bin/sync-dotfiles
#+end_src

Now Reboot.
