This section of the README is dedicated to setting up the dots.
Run the

** Setting Up the Repo
First, to get access to the files, so you can install the dots, clone the repo with git clone

** Run the Sync Script
The Sync Script will make symlinks in your home directory.
One alternative to this is to run ~stow .~

#+begin_src shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# make sure you are in the dotfiles directory:
cd ~/.dotfiles/

# make sure you have the permissions for it
sudo chmod +x bin/sync-dotfiles

# run it
./bin/sync-dotfiles
#+end_src

Now Reboot.
